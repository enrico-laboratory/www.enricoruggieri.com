Madrigale Den Haag's first project is called “Mantova”. We will perform madrigals by the most prominent musician in Mantua of the mid 16th century: Giaches de Wert. He was known for his highly expressive musical language, great contrasts and declamatory style, which were the ingredients of the beginning of the 17th century madrigal style developed by Claudio Monteverdi. From Mantua we will travel to Ferrara, an important Italian musical center where de Wert met his first source of inspiration, Cipriano de Rore, and where he and his colleagues, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, and others, developed further the madrigal style.
