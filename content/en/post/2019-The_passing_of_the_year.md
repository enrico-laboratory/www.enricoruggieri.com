The Quod Libet wants to celebrate its 45 jubilee with a performance of one of the most recent compositions by the British composer Jonathan Dove. The music, for piano and double choir carries an evocative title: “The passing of the year”. It describes the cycle of seasons as a symbolic path through the cycle of human life. Jonathan Dove is one of the most known contemporary British composers, broadly active in the sphere of vocal music, already recognised as one of the prominent British composers of our time. His “The passing of the year” has been recorded several times, recently by Voices 8, but probably the Quod Libet will perform a premier of this music in the Netherlands.
The Quod Libet program comprise a cappella music of other celebrated English composers, Edward Elgar and Benjamin Britten and a celebrative Te Deum for soli, choir and organ by Felix Mendelssohn.
